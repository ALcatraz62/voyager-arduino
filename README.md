# voyager-arduino
Arduino controller code for voyager scale model special effects.
Still very much a work in progress. The goal is to have the controller handle button inputs and controlling various pins to the lighting outputs.

Current State includes<br>
<b>Navigation Lights Control</b>: A button cycles thru the effect state either off, blinking, or steady on.  There are 2 pins with the navigation lights one for always on lights and the other for a blinking beacon light.
